# British Airways Review Analysis

This repository contains the analysis of customer reviews for British Airways, focusing on sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and other insights to improve customer satisfaction.

## Project Overview

In this project, I scraped review data from Skytrax for British Airways and performed various data analyses, including sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and word clouds. The goal is to uncover key trends and actionable insights from customer feedback.

## Structure

- **Notebook**: The main analysis is contained within a Jupyter Notebook, where all the necessary code, imports, and visualizations are provided.

## Requirements

All the required libraries and packages are listed within the notebook. There is no separate `requirements.txt` file as the necessary imports are directly within the notebook itself.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/balajiVijayaraj7/British_Airways_Review_Analysis.git
